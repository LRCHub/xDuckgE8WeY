[00:04.42] This is a call to arms
[00:06.76] To live and love and sleep together
[00:24.26] 
[00:17.30] We could flood the streets
[00:19.79] With love or light or heat, whatever
[00:37.79] 
[00:31.05] Lock the parents out
[00:32.79] Cut a rug, twist and shout
[00:36.29] Wave your hands, make it rain
[00:39.15] The stars will rise again
[00:51.65]

[01:19.77] 
[01:39.12] In a couple of years
[01:40.82] Tides have turned from boos to cheers
[01:59.32] 
[01:51.54] And in spite of the weather
[01:53.86] We can learn to make it together
[02:09.86]
