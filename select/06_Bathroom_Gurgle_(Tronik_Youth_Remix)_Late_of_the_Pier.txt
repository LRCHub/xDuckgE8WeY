We have all been wasting our time
For sunlight

There's only so much we'll take
Far from the only live brown ocean

She was only bidding her time
Falling dimes

Working nine to five in her store
Wasting ti.iya.iya.me ([gurgle])

There's only so much we'll take
Far from the only live brown ocean

Find yourself a new boy
Find yourself a new boy
Find yourself a new boy, boy
Find yourself a new boy

I was in love
But I only knew what I had till I finally told you
I only know, what's harder too.whaoo.oo, yeah
I was in love
But I only say, what I had but ya found, just I love you
I only know, what's harder too.whaoo.oo

So put your hands on your waste-line
And move your body to the bass-line
And get your hands on some cheap wine
And get out, get out, like a motherfucking trout get ya
Hands on your waste-line
And move your body to the bass-line
And get your hands on some cheap wine
And just ignore it till you feel fine

I was in love
But I only knew what I had till I finally told you
I only know, what's harder too.whaoo.oo, yeah
I was in love
But I only say, what I had but ya found, just I love you
I only know, what's harder too.whaoo.oo, ha

So put your hands on your waste-line
And move your body to the bass-line
And get your hands on some cheap wine
And get out, get out, like a motherfucking trout
With ya high flying identified, dignified woman
And Motherfucking beast, a beast of fine crewman
You wanna piece of me, picked up on the street
