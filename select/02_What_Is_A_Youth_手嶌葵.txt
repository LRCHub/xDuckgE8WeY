What is a youth? Impetuous fire
What is a maid? Ice and desire
The world wags on
A rose will bloom
It then will fade
So does a youth
So does the fairest maid
Comes a time when one sweet smile
Has its season for a while
Then love's in love with me
Some they think only to marry
Other will tease and tarry
Mine is the very best parry
Cupid, he rules us all
Caper the cape, but sing me the song
Death will come soon to hush us along
Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall
Love is a task and it never will pall
Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall
Cupid, he rules us all
What is a youth? Impetuous fire
What is a maid? Ice and desire
The world wags on
A rose will bloom
It then will fade
So does a youth
So does the fairest maid
