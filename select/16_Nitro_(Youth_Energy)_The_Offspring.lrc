[00:11.80] Our generation sees the world
[00:14.96] Not the same as before
[00:17.87] We might as well just throw it all
[00:22.11] And live like there's no tomorrow
[00:25.98] There's no tomorrow, there's no tomorrow
[00:45.98] 
[00:41.85] We are the ones
[00:43.61] Who are living under the gun every day
[00:47.73] You might be gone before you know
[00:52.11] So live like there's no tomorrow
[01:08.11] 
[00:54.47] (Ain't gonna waste this life)
[00:56.19] There's no tomorrow
[00:57.69] (Ain't gonna live it for me)
[00:59.09] There's no tomorrow
[01:00.52] (Ain't gonna waste this life)
[01:01.73] There's no tomorrow
[01:03.98] (Ain't gonna live it for me)
[01:17.98] 
[01:06.56] Believe it the official view of the world has changed
[01:10.44] In a whole new way
[01:12.40] Live fast 'cause if you don't take it, you'll never make it
[01:41.90] 
[01:36.29] So if you understand me
[01:39.32] And if you feel the same
[01:42.48] Then you will know what nitro means
[01:46.85] You'll live like there's no tomorrow
[02:04.85] 
[01:49.22] (Ain't gonna waste this life)
[01:50.81] There's no tomorrow
[01:52.32] (Ain't gonna live it for me)
[01:53.79] There's no tomorrow
[01:55.17] (Ain't gonna waste this life)
[01:56.75] There's no tomorrow
[01:58.24] (Ain't gonna live it for me)
[01:59.81] There's no tomorrow
